# Activity 1

This project creates a lineal regression of the number of coronavirus cases as a function of days. The data was obtained using web scrapping, from the record of the worlds’ coronavirus cases reported on: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ , specifically from the "Total Cases" graph on this page. The results were then plotted for better visualization. 

This project is useful since it is an example of how the techniques of web scrapping are used, and because it creates a simple model for approximating how the world’s cases of coronavirus are modeled as a function of time.
